               <h2>   The role of the linker from the perspective of specialty coffee roasters</h2>
                
               <h4>  
                In the run-up to the official launch of our Trader profile on 
                Beyco, we are taking you into the world of coffee trade and 
                the role of traders. In the previous blog of this series, we 
                discussed the role of a trader from the perspective of specialty 
                coffee producer organizations. We talked with Andy Carlton,
                 managing director of Zombo Coffee Partners in Uganda, about 
                 his perspective on coffee traders and the good relationship 
                 Zombo has with partner This Side Up. For Zombo, This Side Up
                fulfills the role of bringing their coffee to the consumer
                 market. A major advantage of selling their coffee to them 
                 is that they buy their coffee in one go, which they later
                 distribute to individual roasters interested in Zombo 
                 Coffee. Selling and exporting coffee in bags to each separate
                    roaster is incredibly expensive for a specialty coffee
                 producer such as Zombo, so selling larger amounts to an
                 importer who manages the logistics, storage and 
                 distribution ultimately saves money and makes trade 
                 more efficient.

                For this blog, we again discuss the role of a trader, but this
                time from the perspective of a roaster. We did an interview with
                Kerissa Narine, responsible 
                for sourcing and impact at Wakuli. Wakuli is an Amsterdam based roaster that 
aims to build personal relationships with the producer organizations they work
 with to be able to not only buy their coffee, but also invest in improving
  field practices. In combination with paying a higher price, they want to 
  enable a sustainable livelihood for the farming communities and ensure the
   continuation of growing the best tasting coffee. Like Zombo, Wakuli also 
   works with This Side Up, who is the facilitating partner when they buy 
   coffee from Zombo.
   
Sourcing and impact at Wakuli Kerissa explains what it means to be responsible
 for sourcing and impact at Wakuli. “Essentially, my job is to develop sourcing
  relationships. This involves finding producer organizations or other partners 
  to work with and look for coffees that we as Wakuli would like to buy. This
   also includes collecting data to track our impact from purchases. So, getting
    cost breakdowns from A to B, help manage logistics from A to B, and report
     and create content for customers and our team to be able to communicate
      these stories.”

She further continues on the goal of Wakuli, stating: “Our impact goal at Wakuli
 is to increase value for farmers. We not only purchase coffee, but also aim to 
 build a trust relationship with producer organizations and assist them with 
 projects they work on to increase farmer income and improve farm practices.
  Of course, we can say that as much as we like, but when you go up to a group 
  who has been promised these things so many times without proper result, it is
   hard to build up a good trusting relationship. The only way for us to confirm 
   what we are saying is to show the numbers and verify it. That is why it is in 
   our value to build trust. We try as much as possible to get alignment. So, 
   coffee trade for us is very much a collaborative endeavour.”

The role of a trader for Wakuli
For Wakuli, direct trade is an important aspect of their business. This means 
they directly communicate with, and buy coffee from, the producer organizations
 they have built strong relationships with. Of course, however, the transport of
  coffee from country of origin to the Netherlands requires logistics, insurance
  , risk management, warehousing and finance. Therefore, for transporting the
   coffee from the country of origin to the Netherlands, Wakuli works with 
   valuable service providers.
“We as Wakuli define direct trade as us knowing the producer. We agree on 
the price paid to the producer, we agree on a payment structure, and then we
 use valuable middlemen or service providers to get the coffee from A to B.”

visit partners in Colombia.
What is the added value of working with a trader for Wakuli?
Kerissa explains why Wakuli makes use of such service providers.
 “Because realistically, managing logistics for 15 origins is not feasible for a small company, but also not as efficient as if we do it through a valuable partner like This Side Up. That is why we use service providers. Our priority is that these service providers add value and that we can be transparent about the value that they add to farmers as well as customers and investors and the team. It is important that we are not ashamed that we pay to get the coffee delivered but provide the “why” of why we use a service provider; being transparent on why we use it!”
About the role of traders, Kerissa shares: “I think that traders often come across as the “bad middlemen’’. The term trader has a dark tint to it. However, it is an unrealistic standard for anybody to think that direct trade is classified as a roaster buying directly from a farmer. Because, how about washing stations or milling costs, or exporters, or all the people in between that provide services that add value to the end product? A farmer would not be able to sell all the production of his farm and export that. That’s not how it works. Wakuli has the benefit of having a bit more scale. But as a small roaster who wants to make an impact, you cannot buy 5 bags directly from a farmer and pay for transport of a full container. That is very expensive.”

The relationship with This Side Up
Specifically on This Side Up, Kerissa shares that in a lot of ways they are what an ideal trader would look like, because they prioritize relationships. “We are in contact with producer organizations themselves. That, for us, is fundamental. That is, from our perspective, direct trade. We develop a relationship and together figure out how we can make coffee purchases happen. Sometimes, that is two years before we can start buying coffee. We need development before we start exporting together for the first time. As a small company it is quite hard to do that, but with This Side Up being the main trading partner, we could make these direct relations possible and align with their vision.”
Kerissa then explains that This Side Up also creates impact by facilitating the movement of coffee from country of origin to Europe, which resonates with Andy’s perspective on the role of a trader. “By filling half of a container and making that container able to move, the other half can be filled with other coffee purchases”.

Other service providers
Besides This Side Up, Wakuli also works with service provider Algrano. Where This Side Up helps with sourcing and is also involved in building trust and relationships, Algrano assists Wakuli with logistics management. “We work with Algrano, which is not exactly the same as how we work with This Side Up. We do not really use them as a sourcing partner per se as we would do with This Side Up, but they help us with a lot of logistics management. Usually, we have a partner for coffees, we source them, we want to get them from A to B, and we use Algrano to help us make that possible. They are the service provider in this case.”
Beyco Trader Profile
With the trader profile on Beyco, traders, or value chain facilitators, can be included in the trade to offer their services. Whether this is about coffee purchase or sales, logistics, finance, insurance or price risk management services, a trader can be involved or specifically be requested to provide a service. Ultimately, the idea is that Wakuli can purchase coffee from Zombo Coffee Partners through Beyco, with This Side Up as the facilitating partner in between. Beyco facilitates traceability of this supply chain, from the Zombo Coffee Partners, to This Side Up, to Wakuli. Traceability is maintained when This Side Up purchases coffee and sells this through to a roaster such as Wakuli. In this way, Beyco makes it possible to show where purchased coffee comes from, as well to whom it has been sold to. A trader as well as roaster can provide information to clients about the origin of its sourced coffee. Furthermore, this facilitates greater transparency of the coffee value chain!
In the coming time we will explain more about the functionality of the trader profile that will be released soon. We are proud to be working with both Wakuli and This Side Up.
