               <h2>   The different forms of blockchain</h2>
               <h3>  And what kind of blockchain we use on our Beyco platform</h3>
               <h4>  
                In our series of articles on blockchain, we take you to us through the different aspects that make blockchain technology. The series explains blockchain in simple steps, looking at the technology from different perspectives. The first blog introduces blockchain, simply describing what it is from a broad perspective. The second blog,delves a little into the primordial mechanism of blockchain, explaining blocks, hash codes and why it is considered as a secure technology.
                Now that we know a little about the basics of blockchain technology, in this blog we will delve into the different forms of blockchain. This will help you understand what kind of blockchain we use on our Beyco platform and, of course, why. Different shapes? Are there different forms of blockchain? Yes! There is no such thing as a single type of blockchain. Let's elaborate...
                Broadly speaking, there are three common varieties of blockchain: public, private, and authorized blockchain. Let's start with the public blockchain. A public blockchain allows anyone and everyone to join and contribute to the network. Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency that handles a public blockchain. Basically, Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates without a central bank. Normally, we have federal banks that are responsible for our monetary systems. Now Bitcoin doesn't have a single person or organization in charge! Bitcoin was created with the idea that anyone who joined Bitcoin could "be their own bank" and no intermediary was needed. This is the idea of a public blockchain: a public network where everyone can join whenever they want. There are no restrictions on participation. In addition to Bitcoin, Etherum is another example of a popular cryptocurrency that is handled on a public blockchain. People appreciate a public blockchain for its true decentralization, as well as the anonymity it allows the user. Also, since everyone has a copy of the ledger on their computer, it creates a distributed nature as well.
