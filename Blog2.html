               <h2>   The different forms of blockchain</h2>
               <h3>  And what kind of blockchain we use on our Beyco platform</h3>
               <h4>  
                     In our blockchain blog series, we take you along with us into the
                     different aspects of blockchain technology. The series explains 
                     blockchain in simple steps, looking at the technology from different
                     perspectives. The first blog introduces blockchain, simply 
                     describing what it is from a broader perspective. The second blog 
                     dives deeper into the primary mechanism of blockchain, explaining 
                     blocks, hashes and ultimately why it is considered such a safe 
                     technology.

                     As we now know a little bit more about the basics of blockchain,
                     for this third blog we dive deeper into the different forms of 
                     blockchain. This will help you understand what type of 
                     blockchain we use for our trading platform Beyco, and of course, why. 
                     Different forms? Are there multiple forms of blockchain? Yes! There
                     is no such thing as one type of blockchain. Let us elaborate…

                     Broadly speaking, there are three common varieties of blockchain:
                     public, private and permissioned blockchains. Let’s start with the 
                     public blockchain. A public blockchain enables anyone and everyone
                     to join and contribute to the network. Bitcoin is the most 
                     well-known cryptocurrency that runs on a public blockchain. 
                     Basically, Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates without a 
                     central bank. Normally, we have federal banks that are responsible 
                     for our monetary systems. Now Bitcoin does not have a single person
                     or organization in charge! Bitcoin was created with the idea that
                     everyone joining Bitcoin could “be their own bank” and no middlemen
                     would be needed. This is the idea of a public blockchain: a public
                     network where anyone can join whenever they want. There are no 
                     restrictions when it comes to participation. Next to Bitcoin,
                     Ethereum is another example of a popular cryptocurrency that 
                     runs on a public blockchain. People appreciate a public blockchain
                     for its true decentralization and anonymity as a user. Also, as 
                     everyone has a copy of the ledger on their computer, it creates 
                     a distributed nature as well.

                     So, what is the difference with a private blockchain? With a private 
                     blockchain, only a single organization has authority over the network. 
                     So, it is not open for the public to join in. Private blockchains are
                     mostly used for internal networking of a company and are considered 
                     not much different from a regular database.The third category of 
                     blockchains is permissioned blockchains. This type of blockchain can
                     be seen as a mix between a public and private blockchain, with many 
                     customization options. For example, either anyone is allowed to join 
                     after verification of identity, or special permissions are given
                     exclusively to parties performing certain activities. Permissioned 
                     blockchains have increased in popularity for supply chains, because 
                     of the ability to give specific permissions to each user on the 
                     network. So, for instance, certain participants may be given the 
                     authorization to see particular information, while others are allowed
                     to view a broader range of information. This gives businesses 
                     participating in the blockchain the security to share certain 
                     information with others that they only want that party to see. 
                     Moreover, this blockchain type enables businesses to comply with 
                     international data protection or privacy rules!

                     Now that we know more about these three types, what does this have to
                     do with Beyco? If a blockchain network is used for coffee trading from
                     origin to cup, the process involves multiple parties. Producers, 
                     exporters, importers, traders, roasters and service providers all serve 
                     a specific role to get the coffee from country of origin to the end 
                     consumer. Also, when trade finance is connected, financiers are also 
                     involved in the chain. In this case, a permissioned network is the best
                     fit for a platform like Beyco.

                     Why? First, the permissioned blockchain allows for verification of 
                     registrations. Beyco looks at every new registration and performs a 
                     Customer Due Diligence to make sure we facilitate a platform of trusted 
                     parties. This explains the name permissioned blockchain! It allows the
                     facilitator to give permission for users to participate in the platform. 
                     Second, it makes sure every user is the owner of its own data. 
                     The permissioned blockchain enables users to record, own and manage their
                     own data. Beyco is solely the independent non-profit facilitator of the 
                     platform. So, instead of a private blockchain in which one party records
                     all the information, the permissioned blockchain network enables every 
                      user, whether this is a producer organization, roaster or trader, to 
                     themselves be the manager of their data. Third, it enables users to 
                     choose what information they would like to share and whatnot. So, users 
                     can choose to publicly share a contract or to have the contract only 
                     visible between the two parties who sign the contract. In this way, 
                     Beyco enables the recording of personal data and individual contracts 
                     between two parties. Details of such a contract are defined between 
                     both the buyer and seller.
